# Welcome 👋

## 🌱 About me
I'm a research assistant. My specialisation is mostly theoretical particle physics,
my current research area is related to heavy ion physics (simulations).

My expected PhD topic is focused on Lattice Field Theory, particularly Lattice QCD.
In the meantime I will work and engage in content creation.

Check out my Docker Hub repos [here](https://hub.docker.com/u/77rev)!

### 🚧 In progress
- 🔬 Self-studying Lattice Field Theory and String Theory (when time allows).
- 🛡️ Learning cybersecurity: information security, defensive & offensive cybersecurity (when time allows).
- 💻 Learning: Rust, Assembly and HTML (when time allows).

### 🔭 Educational background
- BSc in Physics | 2020-2023 | Thesis: Dynamics of Solvable Quantum Systems
- MSc in Physics | 2023-2026 | Thesis: Pion-Scalar Coupled Effective Field Theory

For the MSc thesis I constructed a new, general EFT model for non-Abelian gauge theories with many (N_f > 6) fermions.
It is an extension of ChPT with a light scalar particle using the most general form of coupling.

I will have my final exam in 2026 January or February.

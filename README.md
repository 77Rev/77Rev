# Welcome ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸŒ± About me
I'm an MSc physics student, specialising in theoretical particle physics.
My expected graduation date is June 2025.

I have a discord server, called Pixel Science (you can find it on Disboard.org, STEM keyword).

My expected PhD topic is related to Lattice Field Theory, more specifically to Lattice QCD.
I will begin the PhD studies in autumn 2026, till that I am planning to work and engage in content creation.

### ðŸ”° Miscellaneous
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a new EFT model in non-perturbative QCD, using the calculation methods of Dilaton Chiral Perturbation Theory.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Lattice Field Theory and String Theory.
- ðŸ’» I'm learning the following programming languages (whenever I have time): Rust, Assembly, HTML.
- ðŸ’» I use Arch Linux and CachyOS currently, but I am also familiar with Alpine Linux and Debian based distros. 
- ðŸ’¬ You can ask me about Physics, Maths or Linux.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me on Discord: 77rev
- ðŸ“« You can reach me on Matrix: 77apollyon:matrix.org
- ðŸ“œ My plan for the near future is to create a TikTok channel and post Physics, Maths and Linux related content.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- ðŸ§² Fun fact 1: When I was 14, I participated in a country level astronomy competition and finished 2nd.
- ðŸ§² Fun fact 2: I'm into gaming, e.g. I play World of Warships and WARNO.
- ðŸ§² Fun fact 3: I love the SCP universe and the related lore.

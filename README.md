# Welcome 👋

## 🌱 About me
I'm a research assistant. My specialisation is mostly theoretical nuclear & particle physics.

Check out my Docker Hub repos [here](https://hub.docker.com/u/77rev)!

### 🚧 In progress
- 🔬 Self-studying Lattice Field Theory and String Theory (when time allows).
- 🛡️ Learning cybersecurity: information security, threat intelligence, malware analysis, cryptography and network pentesting (when time allows).
- 💻 Learning Rust (when time allows).

### 🔭 Educational background
- BSc in Physics | 2020-2023 | Thesis: Dynamics of Solvable Quantum Systems
- MSc in Physics | 2023-2026 | Thesis: Pion-Scalar Coupled Effective Field Theory

For the MSc thesis I constructed a new, general EFT model for non-Abelian gauge theories with many (N_f > 6) fermions.
It is an extension of ChPT with a light scalar particle using the most general form of coupling.

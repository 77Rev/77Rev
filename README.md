# Welcome 👋

## 🌱 About me
I'm a research assistant. My specialisation is mostly theoretical particle physics,
my current research area is related to heavy ion collisions.

I have a STEM focused discord server. You may contact me to ask for an invite.

My expected PhD topic is focused on Lattice Field Theory, particularly Lattice QCD.
In the meantime I will work and engage in content creation.

### 🚧 In progress
- 📦 Learning [Rivet](https://rivet.hepforge.org/), [Pythia](https://pythia.org/) and HIJING++ for proton-proton and heavy-ion collision MC event generation & data analysis.
- 🔬 Self-studying Lattice Field Theory and String Theory (when time allows).
- 🛡️ Learning cybersecurity: information security, defensive & offensive cybersecurity (I use [Blackarch](https://www.blackarch.org/wiki.html) and sometimes [Kali](https://www.kali.org/))
- 💻 Learning: Rust, Assembly and HTML (when time allows).

### 📫 Contact
- 📫 You can reach me on Matrix: @77apollyon:matrix.org

### 🔭 Educational background
- BSc in Physics | 2020-2023 | Thesis: Dynamics of Solvable Quantum Systems
- MSc in Physics | 2023-2025 | Thesis: Pion-Scalar Coupled Effective Field Theory

For the MSc thesis I constructed a new, general EFT model for non-Abelian gauge theories with many (N_f > 6) fermions.
It is an extension of ChPT with a light scalar particle using the most general form of coupling.

### 💾 Technical Skills

# Welcome ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸŒ± About me
I'm an MSc physics student, specialising in theoretical particle physics.
My expected graduation date is June 2025.

I have a discord server, called Pixel Science (you can find it on Disboard.org, STEM keyword),
and I'm planning to create a TikTok channel where I will post Physics, Maths and Linux related content.

My expected PhD topic is Lattice QCD, starting in autumn 2026.
Till that I am planning on working, and engaging in content creation.

### ðŸ”° Miscellaneous
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a new model in non-perturbative QCD, with the calculation methods of Dilaton Chiral Perturbation Theory.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Lattice Field Theory and String Theory.
- ðŸ’» I'm learning the following programming languages (whenever I have time): Rust, Assembly, HTML.
- ðŸ’¬ You can ask me about Physics, Maths or Linux.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me on discord: 77rev
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- ðŸ§² Fun fact: When I was 14, I participated in a country level astronomy competition and finished 2nd.

### ðŸ‘¾ Hobbies
- Cybersecurity: information security and defensive cybersecurity in particular.
- Worldbuilding

### ðŸ’¾ Technical Skills
- Bash
- C/C++
- Python
- LaTeX
- Rust (beginner)
- Assembly (beginner)
- HTML (beginner)

I am mostly using Arch Linux based Linux distributions, but I am also familiar with Debian based systems and Alpine Linux.

### ðŸ“– Languages
- Hungarian (native)
- English (C2)
- German (beginner)
- Russian (beginner)

### ðŸ”­ Educational background
- BSc in Physics | 2020-2023 | Thesis: Dynamics of Solvable Quantum Systems
- MSc in Physics | 2023-2025 | Thesis: Pion-Dilaton Coupled Effective Field Theory

### ðŸ“¡ Research Interests
- Lattice Field Theories
- CFTs and Near-Conformal Dynamics
- Non-perturbative QCD and Effective Field Theories (e.g. ChPT, dChPT)
- Beyond-Standard Model theories (e.g. composite Higgs, dark sectors, string theory)

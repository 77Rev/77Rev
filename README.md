# Welcome 👋

## 🌱 About me
I'm an MSc physics student, specialising in theoretical particle physics.
My expected graduation date is June 2025.

I have a discord server, called Pixel Science (you can find it on Disboard.org, Science keyword).

My expected PhD topic is related to Lattice Field Theory, more specifically to Lattice QCD.
I will begin the PhD studies in autumn 2026, till that I am planning to work and engage in content creation.

### 🔰 Miscellaneous
- 🔭 For my MSc thesis I constructed a new, general EFT model for non-Abelian gauge theories with many (N_f > 6) fermions. It is an extension of ChPT with an light scalar particle using the most general form of coupling.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Lattice Field Theory and String Theory.
- 💻 I'm learning the following programming languages (whenever I have time): Rust, Assembly, HTML.
- 💻 I use Arch Linux currently, but I am also familiar with Alpine Linux and Debian based distros. 
- 💬 You can ask me about Physics, Maths or Linux.
- 📫 You can reach me on Discord: 77rev
- 📫 You can reach me on Matrix: 77apollyon:matrix.org
- 📜 My plan for the near future is to create a TikTok channel and post Physics, Maths and Linux related content.

- 🧲 Fun fact 1: When I was 14, I participated in a country level astronomy competition and finished 2nd.
- 🧲 Fun fact 2: I'm into gaming, e.g. I play World of Warships and WARNO.
- 🧲 Fun fact 3: I love the SCP universe and the related lore.
